Performance, 7000 iterations, EN-IT trainingsdata on language recognition:
1 layer , 10 nodes each.	86% accuracy
2 layers, 10 nodes each.	80% accuracy
3 layers, 10 nodes each.	15 min+ for setup, aborted

1 layer,  20 nodes each.	83% accuracy
1 layer,   5 nodes each.	83% accuracy
2 layers,  5 nodes each.	86% accuracy
1 layer, 100 nodes each.    86% accuracy

Seems like 86% is the upper bound for this data.
